## Description

This crate contains the trait `MultipartWrite`, assorted implementations, and combinators.

A `MultipartWrite` is a similar interface to [`Sink`], except that writing an item or completing the
write both return values.

[Here][example] is a conceptual example of a `MultipartWrite`.

## Motivation

`Sink` is a useful API, but it is just that--a sink.  The end of a stream.
It's useful to have the backpressure mechanism that `poll_ready`/`start_send` enables, and it's nice
to have the flexibility that the shape of it provides in what kinds of things you can forward to it.

The idea for `MultipartWrite` is to:
1. Have the same desirable properies as `Sink`.
2. Be able to be inserted at more locations in a stream computation.
3. Be useful in more cases by having a value returned when starting a write.
4. Be able to transform a stream into another stream, which is really just a more specific phrasing of 3.
